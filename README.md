notes on relevant literature


  * [Clustering Methods for Collaborative Filtering](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/1998/WS-98-08/WS98-08-029.pdf) Motivates latent variables for factoring probability distribution in sparse data problems, in this case as user and movie genres.
     Analogy with our case is genres ~ roles and other categories (formal or informal) of user behavior
    
  * [Latent Cross: Making Use of Context in Recurrent Recommender Systems](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46488.pdf) Youtube's approach to incorporating context in neural network youtube clip recommendation
  
  * [Wide and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf) One approach to deep learning with sparse inputs (in this case also for a recommendation system)
  
  * [Tensor Methods and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06038.pdf) Tensor Factorization generalizing matrix factorization for recommendation systems
